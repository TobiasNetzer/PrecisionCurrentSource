## A precision current source that can be configured for currents up to ~10mA.

This project started because I needed a way to verify the current measurement accuracy of the low-current ranges of my datalogger (nanoLogger), as well as use it for calibration purposes. Since I donâ€™t own a programmable current source like a Keithley 220 or SMU, I came up with this approach instead. Check [here](https://tobiasnetzer.github.io/posts/current-source/) for more info.
